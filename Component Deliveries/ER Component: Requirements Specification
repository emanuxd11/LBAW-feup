# ER: Requirements Specification Component

## A1: Project Management

The primary objective of this project is to develop an efficient information system, featuring an intuitive web interface tailored to meet intricate project requirements and attract organizations for enhanced productivity. Our core mission is to provide users with a robust yet user-friendly and reliable project management platform.

Within the application, organizations can seamlessly oversee multiple projects simultaneously. Each project includes tasks, team members, and well-defined deadlines. Crucially, our platform incorporates a chat forum that facilitates collaboration among users working on the same project.

Accessing the platform is straightforward; organizations simply need to register. Team coordinators or administrators initiate this process by extending invitations to team members to simplify account creation. This approach allows users to utilize the system across various professional contexts using the same email address and easily access it for effective collaboration after registration.

Our platform introduces a finely-tuned system of user roles, ensuring that individuals can interact with the application based on their specific responsibilities. Here's a breakdown of these roles:

Visitors are our basic users, with access to authentication and public information. Authenticated Users enjoy enhanced privileges, enabling them to create, explore, and manage projects seamlessly. Project Members are the backbone of project teams, wielding capabilities for task management, forum engagement, and collaborative roles. Project Coordinators, equipped with comprehensive permissions, take on supervisory responsibilities and can manage project memberships and details. To manage user access throughout the organization, our system appoints an Administrator with extensive authority, providing them with access to project details and specific project-related information.

Lastly, our platform includes an extensive notification system to keep users informed and engaged. These notifications encompass project invitations, task assignments, forum activities, and milestone updates, promoting efficient communication, heightened productivity, and overall project success.

In conclusion, our project aims to deliver a cohesive and efficient project management solution. We are committed to enhancing productivity, fostering collaboration, and simplifying project management processes.
