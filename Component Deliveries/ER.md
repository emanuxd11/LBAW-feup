# ER: Requirements Specification Component

## A1: Project Management

This artefact aims to provide a comprehensive description of the project, including its objectives, key stakeholders, and the underlying motivations that drive its development.

### Project Description

The primary objective of **ProjectSync** is to develop an efficient information system, featuring an intuitive web interface tailored to meet intricate project requirements and attract organizations for enhanced productivity. Our core mission is to provide users with a robust yet user-friendly and reliable project management platform.

Within the application, organizations can seamlessly oversee multiple projects simultaneously. Each project includes tasks, team members, and well-defined deadlines. Crucially, our platform incorporates a chat forum that facilitates collaboration among users working on the same project.

Accessing the platform is straightforward; organizations simply need to register. Team coordinators or administrators initiate this process by extending invitations to team members to simplify account creation. This approach allows users to utilize the system across various professional contexts using the same email address and easily access it for effective collaboration after registration.

Our platform introduces a finely-tuned system of user roles, ensuring that individuals can interact with the application based on their specific responsibilities. Here's a breakdown of these roles:

Visitors are our basic users, with access to authentication and public information. Authenticated Users enjoy enhanced privileges, enabling them to create, explore, and manage projects seamlessly. Project Members are the backbone of project teams, wielding capabilities for task management, forum engagement, and collaborative roles. Project Coordinators, equipped with comprehensive permissions, take on supervisory responsibilities and can manage project memberships and details. To manage user access throughout the organization, our system appoints an Administrator with extensive authority, providing them with access to project details and specific project-related information.

Lastly, our platform includes an extensive notification system to keep users informed and engaged. These notifications encompass project invitations, task assignments, forum activities, and milestone updates, promoting efficient communication, heightened productivity, and overall project success.

In conclusion, our project aims to deliver a cohesive and efficient project management solution. We are committed to enhancing productivity, fostering collaboration, and simplifying project management processes.

## A3: Information Architecture

This artifact primarily aims to craft a prototype for the user interface, incorporating essential features through wireframes, while also detailing the connections between the system's core pages.


### 1. Sitemap

A sitemap serves as a graphical depiction illustrating the interconnections among various web pages within a website, offering a comprehensive overview of how the content is structured and interconnected. It encompasses all intended web pages and offers a bird's-eye view of the website's information architecture, revealing the arrangement and hierarchy of information within the site.

![Sitemap](images\sitemap_2363.png)


The **ProjectSync** system is structured into five primary domains, encompassing static pages for system information dissemination (Static Pages), pages facilitating the exploration and organization of the project teams and tasks (Project Pages), individual user-specific pages such as the user profile (Authenticated User Pages), authentication pages for user login and registration (Users Authentication Pages), and sections dedicated to administrative functionalities (Admin Pages).


### 2. Wireframes

Wireframes serve as essential blueprints in the realm of web design and application development. They offer a structured visualization of layout concepts, content placement, and the overarching design at the page level. These wireframes meticulously allocate space, provide a clear hierarchy of content, and illuminate the availability of various features within the design canvas. Furthermore, wireframes are invaluable tools that help streamline the decision-making process and ensure that design ideas are effectively communicated among team members and stakeholders.

For the **ProjectSync** system, the wireframes for the **HomePage (UI01)**, the **Login page (UI06)** and the **Project Workspace (UI07)** are presented below.
